# Score Keeper App

This is a score keeping app that allows the user to keep track of the scores of two teams playing against each other. 
The user can use two sets of buttons for each team to increase or decrease their scores respectively. 
The app also includes a set of radio buttons that allow the user to select the point value for each action. 
Finally, the app prevents scores from going below zero and allows the user to set a limit for each team's score.

## Getting Started

I am using Android Studio with Kotlin.
